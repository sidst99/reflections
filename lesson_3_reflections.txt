When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When the project involves other people working in it as well, or when we want to make changes to the project from different pcs, or to save the project remotely so as to protect it from local failures, or to share it with everyone.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because when many people are working on the same project continuous changes to the repository may occur and that may hamper the work or changes we are trying to do.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used to make a remote copy of a repository on GitHub. Clone is used to make a local copy of either a remote repository on GitHub or a local repository. Branch basically operates on one repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that we can know by using git diff master origin/master the changes that we have made since last pulling from the remote.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We have to sit together and work.
It would be easier to resolve conflicts but harder to collaborate because we always would have to work together.
