What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a git repository a .git hidden file is created in the directory and also it becomes a master branch.
This is needed to enable us to do version control of the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the intermediate area between the working directory and the repository.
It allows to commit only the changes that we want in one particular commit.
